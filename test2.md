# Market Leaders and Famous Software Alternatives Supporting s390x

This document lists market-leading or famous non-IBM software alternatives that can replace the original tools, all confirmed to support s390x on Linux on Z (based on vendor docs, community builds, or explicit compatibility). Includes why it replaces, key features, verification link, migration effort, and complexity level. If no strong market leader with s390x support was found, it's noted as "None identified with full support."
