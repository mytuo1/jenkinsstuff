# UAAA Stack replacement/assimilation

The purpose of this document is to create a comperhensive list of possible replacements or assimilations of current UAAA infrastructure. The document will have any applicable IBM propriatery software that could replace the current technology, a market leader (if not the same and if applicable) and the original technology which is applied at the moment.

# Combined Technology Overview for Replacements on s390x

This document combines the original technologies from the spreadsheet with IBM proprietary replacements and market leader alternatives, all supporting s390x where applicable. For each category, three sentences explain each technology (original, IBM, market leader), including its core function, key benefits, compatibility with the original (e.g., migration paths or integration points), and a documentation link. If no market leader with full s390x support is identified, it's noted accordingly. Migration effort and complexity are included for replacements. Support on s390x is indicated with ‚úÖ for supported (preferred choice), ‚ùå for not supported, and üü° for IBM when alternative options exist.
