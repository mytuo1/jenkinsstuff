# IBM Proprietary Software Replacements for Original Technologies

This document lists IBM proprietary software suggestions as replacements for the original tools in the spreadsheet. Each includes a brief explanation of why it replaces the tool, key features, a working verification link, an estimate of migration effort (Low: Minimal changes, plug-and-play; Medium: Some configuration and data transfer; High: Significant redesign, training, and testing), and complexity level (Low: Simple setup; Medium: Moderate integration; High: Advanced customization required). All replacements support s390x architecture on Linux on Z.
